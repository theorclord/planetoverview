Large ships have black health pool
Fighters have red. 
Dice to match

Eks
Acclamator ship
4 black health
//1 red attack die only maybe
2 black attack die
Tie fighter 
1 red health
1 red attack die

Each die goes from 1-10
10 is a crit and may cross over to other damage pools 
Their hit ability depend on the ship?
Or each die has a hit ratio
Eks
Red die
1-6 nothing
7-9 red damage
10 all damage
